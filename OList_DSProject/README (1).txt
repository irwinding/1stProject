Hello, this is a data science project that me and my friends worked on. This is mainly to segment customers into meaningful clusters so that the ecommerce platform can better handle customers.

This is how the files are organised.

EDA1&2 - 2 parts of Exploratory Data Analysis with some data visualisations
RFM Segmentation - Using different clustering methods to segment customers
Cold Start - An attempt to solve a cold start problem that is, what should we do to new customers if they do not have R, F and M data for us to work with?
